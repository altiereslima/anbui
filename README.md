# AnbUI - The Burger Enjoyers' Minimal Text UI Library In C

This does pretty much what it says on the tin... It's a miniature text library in C!

It's designed with absolute ease of use in mind. One or two function calls to get the kind of TUI element you want.

## What can it do?

* Menus
    * Menus with arbitrary items, generated at run time
    * Yes/No Selectors
    * OK message boxes
* Text file display boxes
* Command output display boxes
* Progress bar boxes

A lot of functions support variadic arguments so you don't need to prepare strings to pass to it via temporary buffers and sprintfs.

As I said, minimal code & ease of use is the focus here.

## Limitations

* Probably currently not very thread-safe (at all (please don't))

# Platforms

## MS-DOS

### Open Watcom (`makefile.wcd`)

  Build test application with `wmake -f makefile.wcd`

### Microsoft C 7.00 (`makefile.c7d`)

  Build test application with `nmake makefile.c7d`

## Linux

### GCC

  `gcc -D_ANBUI_TEST_ -O3 -s -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror -oanbui_test pl_linux.c ad_ui.c ad_obj.c ad_text.c anbui.c ad_test.c`

## Windows

### MinGW

  `gcc -D_ANBUI_TEST_ -O3 -s -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror -oanbui_win.exe pl_win32.c ad_ui.c ad_obj.c ad_text.c anbui.c ad_test.c`

## API Reference

Please look at [`anbui.h`](anbui.h).

## What's with the name...?

My partner plays a video game called Zenless Zone Zero. I It's not my type of game, but it has a character named Anby Demara. This character has an unholy obsession with burgers, which I relate to :D

That's where AnbUI and all the references come from.

## License

I've been a professional software engineer for quite a few years now and I still don't know sh*t about licensing.

CC-BY-NC 3.0 says use it, copy it, tell people who made it and don't sell it. Pretty please? :3
